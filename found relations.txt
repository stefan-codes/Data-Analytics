Relation One:
  Location vs ScoreOverall - location D on SO

  first :
  means <- aggregate(so ~  Location, dataset, mean)

  then:
  ggplot(data = dataset, mapping = aes(x = Location, y = so, fill = Gender))
  + geom_boxplot()
  + stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", color = "darkred", size = 3)
  + geom_text(data = means, aes(label = so, y = so + 3.5))
  + labs(title = "Overall score for different locations ", x = "Location", y = "Overall Score")
  + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none")

Relation Two:
    sd for age O is much better than the rest

    first :
    means <- aggregate(sd ~  Age, dataset, mean)

    then:
    ggplot(data = dataset, mapping = aes(x = Age, y = sd, fill = Age))
    + geom_boxplot()
    + stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", color = "darkred", size = 3)
    + geom_text(data = means, aes(label = sd, y = sd + 3.5))
    + labs(title = "Distance score for different age", x = "Age", y = "Distance Score")
    + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none")
    + scale_x_discrete(limits=c("T","U","L","O"))

Relation Three:
    sj on F changes with age

    first :
    means <- aggregate(sj ~  Age, subset(dataset, Gender == "F"), mean)

    then:
    ggplot(data = dataset, mapping = aes(x = Age, y = sj, fill = Age))
    + geom_boxplot()
    + stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", color = "darkred", size = 3)
    + geom_text(data = means, aes(label = sj, y = sj + 3))
    + labs(title = "Jump score of Females for different age", x = "Age", y = "Jump Score")
    + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none")
    + scale_x_discrete(limits=c("T","U","L","O"))

Relation Four:
  ss vs st (correlation) where location is A or C

  ggplot(data = subset(dataset, Location == "A" | Location == "C", mapping = aes(x = ss, y = st, color = Location))
  + geom_point(alpha = 10/10, position = position_dodge(width = 1))
  + labs(title = "Sprint Score against Throw Score for Locations A and C", x = "Sprint Score", y = "Throw Score")
  + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

Relation Five:
  sj vs so liner correlation where Location is A or C with M

  ggplot(data = subset(dataset, (Location == "A" | Location == "C") & Gender == "M"), mapping = aes(x = sj, y = so, color = Location))
  + geom_point(alpha = 10/10, position = position_dodge(width = 1))
  + labs(title = "Jump Score against Overall Score for Locations A and C with Males", x = "Jump Score", y = "Overall Score")
  + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

Relation Six:
  sj vs sd for M from B

  ggplot(data = subset(dataset, Location == "B" & Gender == "M"), mapping = aes(x = sd, y = sj, color = Age)) + geom_point()
  + facet_wrap(~ Age, ncol = 2)
  + labs(title = "Distance Score against Jump Score for location B with Males", x = "Distance Score", y = "Jump Score")
  + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

Relation Seven:
  E vs F vs T vs SS vs SJ

  ggplot(data = subset(dataset, Location == "E" & Gender == "F" & Age == "T"), mapping = aes(x = ss, y = sj, color = Gender)) + geom_point()
  + labs(title = "Sprint Score against Jump Score for location E with Females of age T", x = "Sprint Score", y = "Jump Score")
  + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
